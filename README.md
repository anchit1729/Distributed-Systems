# Distributed-Systems

A collection of all the stuff I learn related to distributed systems and building scalable, robust platforms.

The programs implemented here as exercises are questions from MIT 6.828, Distributed Systems.
Moreover, I am including notes in the repository that will be useful for reference in the future, particularly for interview prep.
